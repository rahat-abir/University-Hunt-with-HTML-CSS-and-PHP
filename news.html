      <h4 class="heading-4">Clash between SUST students and locals</h4>
      <p>A violent clash between students of the Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, or SUST, and locals living in the surrounding neighbourhoods has left scores injured.

        Police said at least eight students were injured in the clash, while the university’s proctor office told http://b...content-available-to-author-only...4.com that at least 15 students sustained injuries.
        
        Assistant Proctor Muhammad Mizanur Rahman confirmed that nine critically injured students were rushed to Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital for treatment.
        
        “The rest were provided first aid at the university’s medical centre,” he said.
        
        Neither police nor the university authorities could confirm how many local people were injured in the clash.
        
        According to witnesses, all the students involved in the clash are members of the university’s Bangladesh Chhatra League unit, while the locals are supporters of a Bangladesh Jubo League leader named Dulal Miah.
        
        Both Chhatra League and Jubo League are associate organisations of the ruling Awami League.
        
        Witnesses said the violence was instigated by a row between some motorcycle-riding outsiders, who forced their way into the university, ignoring a security guard’s request through the main gate of the campus, and some students, who protested the incident.
        
        “The verbal row escalated to a minor scuffle, and the students were able to drive those outsiders out of the gate of the campus. The same outsiders, now bolstered by an increase in their number, came back after a while and started pelting stones at the students by forcefully entering the campus,” said Rakib Mia, a security guard stationed at the main gate of the campus when the incident started,
        
        The university Chhatra League unit’s former secretary for environmental affairs, Khalilur Rahman, said the outsiders’ launched the full-scale attack on the students with sticks and stones while the members of the proctorial body were attempting to calm an already tense situation down.
        
        “The leader of the group of outsiders, Dulal Miah, ordered his followers to throw stones at the students and the staff of the university’s office of the proctor. The stone attack injured at least 15 students. Two of them sustained grave eye injuries,” he said.
        
        Dulal Miah did not receive any of the calls made to his mobile phone from the bdnews24.com correspondent for his version of the events.

      <h4 class="heading-4">Profit shouldn’t be the goal of a public university</h4>
      <p>We're surprised to learn about the huge profit that Dhaka University has made from its admission tests held this year. According to a report by daily Prothom Alo, the profit made from the admission tests for the 2021-22 academic year stands at Tk 17 crore. Although DU authorities claim this to be the university's income, the question is, can a public university make such profits by taking exorbitant fees from admission-seekers?

        Reportedly, the DU administration has increased the fee for admission tests every year since the 2019-2020 academic session, citing various reasons. While the fee was Tk 350 in 2018-19, it was increased to Tk 1,000 by 2021-22. This means the fee was increased by a total of Tk 650 in just three years. Is this justified? Apparently, for the DU authorities, it is. In fact, they've managed to cook up a reason for their action every time. The first time, during the 2019-20 session, they said they had to "slightly" increase it because they were taking written tests for the first time. The reason for the increase the following year was that they were holding the exams outside Dhaka which needed extra spending. This year, they came up with a unique reason – that they could not "adjust their costs" last year through increased fees.
